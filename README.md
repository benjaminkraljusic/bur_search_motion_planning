# Bur Search Motion Planning
 Motion planning for robotic manipulators that combines sampling-based and search-based planning methods. Distance-based burs of free configuration space (C-space) as adaptive motion primitives within the graph search algorithm. The algorithm is implemented within the existing SMPL (Search-Based Motion Planning Library) library.
